# **E-Commerce & Supply Chain Data Warehouse**  
**Phase 1 Deliverable: Project Charter & Scope Definition**

---

## 1. Project Overview

### **Project Name**  
**E-Commerce & Supply Chain Data Warehouse (Global Scale)**

### **Project Description**  
We aim to create a **comprehensive data warehouse solution** integrating orders, inventory, shipping/logistics, and customer behavior from **multiple sources** (both real and synthetic). This system will support **advanced analytics** (recommendation engines, forecasting, performance optimization) and near-real-time operational reporting. Ultimately, this project will **demonstrate an enterprise-grade, end-to-end** data ecosystem for e-commerce and supply chain operations.

## 2. Business Context & Value

### **1. E-Commerce Growth & Complexity**  
- **High Transaction Volume**: Online retail sees large daily order counts, dynamic pricing, and global customers. Data is often siloed across web analytics, order management, and supply chain partners.  
- **Centralized Warehouse**: A single source of truth is critical for accurate reporting, predictive analytics (demand forecasting), and scalable operations (automated restocking, route optimization).

### **2. Supply Chain Dynamics**  
- **Real-Time Visibility**: Post-pandemic disruptions highlight the need for shipping status monitoring, carrier performance metrics, and warehouse capacity insights.  
- **Data Integration**: Multiple logistics providers, varying data formats—this project shows how to unify them for advanced queries (e.g., on-time rates, cost optimization).

### **3. Strategic Impact**  
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Provide management with insights on top-selling products, slow-moving inventory, shipping bottlenecks, and profitable vs. unprofitable segments.  
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Faster fulfillment, fewer stock-outs, targeted product recommendations, and optimized shipping lead to better customer experience.

## 3. Scope & Objectives

### **1. Core Use Cases**  
1. **Sales Performance Tracking**  
   - Monitor **daily/weekly/monthly** revenue, orders, and average order value by region, warehouse, or product category.  
2. **Inventory Management**  
   - Track **real-time stock levels**, reorder thresholds, and warehouse utilization.  
3. **Shipping & Logistics Analytics**  
   - Analyze **carrier on-time delivery**, shipping costs, transit times, and route performance.  
4. **Customer Insights & Segmentation**  
   - Identify **high-value customers**, churn risk, and cross-sell/up-sell opportunities.  
5. **Advanced Analytics (Stretch Goals)**  
   - **Recommendation Engine**: “Customers who bought X also bought Y.”  
   - **Forecasting**: Predict future demand for inventory planning.  
   - **Basket Analysis**: Frequent itemset mining for promotional campaigns.

### **2. Objectives & Key Deliverables**  
- **Integrated Data Model**: Dimensional schema with SCD for changing attributes (e.g., customer addresses, warehouse capacity).  
- **Performance-Optimized Queries**: Using indexing, partitioning, and materialized views to handle large data efficiently.  
- **Automated ETL/ELT**: Scripts or pipelines to ingest raw data from staging to the warehouse on a regular or near-real-time basis.  
- **Security & Access Control**: Role-based permissions to protect sensitive customer/order data.  
- **Dashboards & Visualizations**: Interactive reports (Power BI/Tableau) highlighting key metrics: sales trends, inventory, shipping delays, etc.

### **3. Project Boundaries**  
- **In-Scope**:  
  - Ingestion from external sources (public or synthetic), advanced SQL features (CTEs, window functions, partitioning), demonstration of near-real-time loads (if feasible).  
- **Out-of-Scope**:  
  - Full production environment or real shipping APIs might be beyond immediate scope; we’ll simulate or partially implement them if needed.

## 4. Target Users & Personas

1. **Supply Chain Manager**  
   - Monitors warehouse utilization, carrier performance, on-time delivery, and reorder alerts in a single dashboard.
2. **E-Commerce Marketing Analyst**  
   - Needs to segment customers by purchase tiers/frequency, run cross-sell analyses, measure campaign effectiveness.
3. **Operations / Logistics Team**  
   - Oversees daily shipments, identifies delayed orders, adjusts route allocations or carrier choices to meet SLAs.
4. **Executive Leadership (CEO / CFO)**  
   - Tracks revenue & profit over time, compares performance across regions/warehouses, and drives strategic decisions.

## 5. Analytics Questions & KPIs

1. **Sales & Revenue**  
   - “Which product categories are driving highest revenue growth? Are we hitting monthly sales targets?”  
   - **KPIs**: Total Sales, Average Order Value, Revenue by Region, Growth Rate.

2. **Inventory**  
   - “Which SKUs are nearing stock-out? Do we have excess inventory for certain products?”  
   - **KPIs**: Days of Inventory on Hand, Stock-Out Rate, Inventory Turnover.

3. **Shipping & Logistics**  
   - “What’s our average shipping time by carrier? Where are the major delivery bottlenecks?”  
   - **KPIs**: On-Time Delivery %, Average Transit Time, Shipping Cost per Order.

4. **Customer Behavior**  
   - “How many customers have churned in the last quarter? Can we identify top spenders for special promotions?”  
   - **KPIs**: Churn Rate, Repeat Purchase Rate, Cross-Sell Uptake.

5. **Advanced Analytics**  
   - **Recommendation Engine**: “What are the top 5 frequently co-purchased products?”  
   - **Forecasting**: “Projected sales for Product A next quarter?” or “Predicted shipping volume for next month?”

## 6. Data Sources & Strategy

1. **Transactional E-Commerce Data**  
   - **Orders** (order_id, customer_id, product_id, quantity, order_date, total_price, etc.)  
   - **Customers** (customer_id, name, email, address, sign_up_date, etc.)  
   - **Products** (product_id, name, category, price, etc.)

2. **Supply Chain / Logistics**  
   - **Shipments** (shipment_id, order_id, carrier, ship_date, delivery_date, transit_time, cost)  
   - **Warehouse** (warehouse_id, location, capacity)

3. **Supplementary**  
   - **Web Analytics** (optional) for user behavior data.  
   - **External CSVs/JSON** for simulating large volumes of orders, shipments, or events.

### **Approach**  
- Start with **static CSV/JSON** loads for proof of concept.  
- Optionally add a script to simulate incremental updates (new orders hourly).

## 8. Risks & Assumptions

1. **Data Availability**  
   - **Risk**: Real e-commerce/warehouse data may be proprietary.  
   - **Mitigation**: Use partial public sets (like Olist) + synthetic expansions.

2. **Complexity of Real-Time**  
   - **Risk**: Implementing streaming/triggers can be time-consuming.  
   - **Mitigation**: Start with batch loads; add real-time if schedule permits.

3. **Performance at Scale**  
   - **Risk**: Handling millions of rows requires partitioning, indexing, and possibly more hardware.  
   - **Mitigation**: Implement performance best practices early.

4. **Assumptions**  
   - Enough storage/compute available.  
   - We can design the data model from scratch (no legacy constraints).

---

## 9. Success Criteria

- **Technical Excellence**: Warehouse handles large volumes smoothly; queries run quickly via indexing and partitioning.  
- **Analytical Depth**: At least 3-5 advanced queries (window functions, churn analysis, recommendation) that solve real business questions.  
- **Professional Documentation**: Clear ER diagram, data dictionary, thorough README with run instructions.  
- **Compelling Final Presentation**: Show off interactive dashboards or query demos that highlight business insights and performance.

### **Conclusion & Next Steps**

With this **Phase 1 Project Charter** completed, we have a **clear vision** for an enterprise-level E-commerce & Supply Chain Data Warehouse that leverages advanced SQL capabilities and delivers real-world insights. This sets the stage for design and implementation phases (2–7).

1. **Finalize** any outstanding questions about data sources or scope.  
2. **Confirm** environment setup (PostgreSQL local vs. cloud, version control in GitHub).  
3. Proceed to **Phase 2** for detailed schema design, SCD strategy, and initial DDL scripts.
